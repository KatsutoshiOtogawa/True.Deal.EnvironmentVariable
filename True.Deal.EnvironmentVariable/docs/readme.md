windowsとdotnetには環境変数を壊しうるバグがあります。
それらのバグを避けたうえで環境変数を操作するためのライブラリです。

There is a bug in windows and dotnet that can break environment variables.
This library is designed to avoid those bugs and manipulate environment variables.

https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/1442

## Supported platforms

It is compatible with most of the windows environments in use today.

- .NET Framework 3.5+
- .NET Standard 2.0+
- dotnet6.0+

Net Framework 4.5 or lower version should work, although I have not tested it because I do not have a verification environment.

## support

If you don't know how to use it, you may respond by posting a mentions to my twitter account.
